# Text_mining_unipd_courses
 In May 2024, two friends and I analyzed the course descriptions of all Bachelor Degrees offered at the University of Padua. Our project consisted of three phases: first, we scraped the data from the University's websites; then, we cleaned the data; and finally, we trained models to recognize the "School" associated with each course based on its description.
