In May 2024, Andrea Cocco, Andrea Quartuccio, and I analyzed the course descriptions of all Bachelor Degrees's courses offered at the University of Padua as a project for the exam of statistical methods for Big Data. Our project consisted of three phases:

- **First**, we scraped the data from the University's websites using Python.
- **Secondly**, we cleaned the data by removing duplicate courses, detecting bigrams and trigrams, removing some stopwords, applying a stemming algorithm, and more.
- **Finally**, we trained models to recognize the "School" associated with each course based on its description.
